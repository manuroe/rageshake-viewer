/**
 * Opens a rageshake archive fetched from a URL, reachable from a plain link.
 *
 * This is what makes deep links verifiable: a link carries `line=`, `filter=` and
 * `start=`/`end=` alongside `archive=`, and the recipient lands on the exact log
 * line without dropping the file in by hand.
 *
 * `file=` names one entry to open on its own, and `line=` is then the line number
 * *inside that file* — which is what the `rageshake` CLI prints. It is the fast
 * path by a wide margin: parsing one log takes ~0.3s against ~2.4s for merging
 * all 50-odd logs of a real archive, and a cited line lives in one of them.
 * Without `file=`, every analyzable entry is opened merged (the archive
 * listing's "open all"), for exploring rather than for pointing.
 *
 * The URL must be same-origin or CORS-readable; a local static server pointed at
 * a case folder is the intended source.
 *
 * The hook is a no-op when the `archive` param is absent. A present-but-empty one
 * is simply dropped from the URL.
